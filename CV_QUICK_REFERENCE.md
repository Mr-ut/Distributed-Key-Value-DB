## üé§ **Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)**

_"I built a distributed key-value database that solves the challenge of maintaining data consistency across multiple servers. Using the Raft consensus algorithm in Go, my system automatically elects leaders, replicates data across nodes, and handles server failures without losing data. It's similar to systems like Redis Cluster or Apache Kafka's coordination layer. The project demonstrates my understanding of distributed systems, concurrent programming, and fault-tolerant design - skills directly applicable to building scalable backend systems."_

## üí¨ **Interview Story Framework**

### STAR Format Response:

**Situation**: "I wanted to understand how distributed databases maintain consistency across multiple nodes, especially systems like Redis or MongoDB clusters."

**Task**: "I decided to implement a distributed key-value database using the Raft consensus algorithm to ensure all nodes agree on the same data state."

**Action**: "I implemented the complete Raft protocol in Go, including leader election with randomized timeouts, log replication across nodes, and heartbeat mechanisms. I built a TCP server supporting concurrent clients, user authentication, and CRUD operations. The system handles network partitions and node failures gracefully."

**Result**: "The final system maintains 100% data consistency across nodes, automatically recovers from failures, and supports concurrent operations. I validated this with comprehensive tests including network partition simulation and node failure scenarios."
